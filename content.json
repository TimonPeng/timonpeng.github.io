It uses custom developed firmware(based on OpenWrt, of course) to implement some functions. So we want to view its code and how it implements some functions. Scan portsI used nmap to scan its ports and found that 53, 80 and some custom service ports(I confirmed that they are some http services) were opened. Web interfaceSSH and telnet have not been opened, so I decided to check the web interface. However, only some basic state and networking setting operation pages here. Sniffing upgrade host urlAt that time, the online upgrade function caught my attention. So I decided to sniffing the upgrade url to get the firmware file. I connected GL-MiFi to another RT-AC86U router: Internet &lt;-&gt; RT-AC86U &lt;-&gt; GL-MiFi and run tcpdump on RT-AC86U, then use Wireshark, I got the upgrade host ip. Then I forwarded all the original traffic to my ip on RT-AC86U. 1iptables -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -j DNAT -d ORIGINAL-IP --match multiport --dports 80,443 --to-destination MY-IP nat I can see the request urls now. So I wrote a small Flask app to handle all url and response fake data of upgrade request. 1234version=10.0date=2019-7-25filename=upgrade_10.0.binmd5=xxxxxx Now I have the url path of the firmware files and downloaded them. View firmwareI used binwalk upgrade.bin | head to check firmware file but got nothing. Then I converted it into HEX string xxd &lt; upgrade.bin | more, after viewing, I think it is an encrypted file. Usually unencrypted firmware files have some features: The first 64 bytes of the file header is 2705 1956, a U-Boot header An operating system string after the U-Boot image header Part of the blank blocks(0xFF) is at the end You can view the U-Boot image header code on GitHub 1234567891011121314typedef struct image_header &#123; uint32_t ih_magic; /* Image Header Magic Number */ uint32_t ih_hcrc; /* Image Header CRC Checksum */ uint32_t ih_time; /* Image Creation Timestamp */ uint32_t ih_size; /* Image Data Size */ uint32_t ih_load; /* Data Load Address */ uint32_t ih_ep; /* Entry Point Address */ uint32_t ih_dcrc; /* Image Data CRC Checksum */ uint8_t ih_os; /* Operating System */ uint8_t ih_arch; /* CPU architecture */ uint8_t ih_type; /* Image Type */ uint8_t ih_comp; /* Compression Type */ uint8_t ih_name[IH_NMLEN]; /* Image Name */&#125; image_header_t; 12345$ xxd &lt; upgrade_decrypto.bin | more00000000: 2705 1956|d2fc 9955|5b20 b51a|0012 c3a7| &apos;..V...U[ ......00000010: 8006 0000|8006 0000|d695 0fbf|05|05|02|03| ................00000020: 4d49 5053 204f 7065 6e57 7274 204c 696e MIPS OpenWrt Lin00000030: 7578 2d33 2e31 382e 3233 0000 0000 0000 ux-3.18.23...... At the same time, I found an article about firmware encryption, so I think the decryption function maybe inside firmware. Now I am in trouble. Hardware debugI decided to tear down it and start with the hardware. Connect to UART port via USB TTL adapter. Adapter Router GND GND TXD RXD RXD TXD According the doc set speed 115200. Run U-Boot mode Press and hold the reset button Power on the unit (keep holding down the reset button) The 3G/4G led will flash Press reset button for at least: 5 sec. to run web failsafe mode 8 sec. to run U-Boot console 10 sec. to run U-Boot netconsole Release the reset button The 3G/4G led will faintly flash twice Then you are in U-Boot mode Now you can read the data in memory. BusyboxOr we can try to use shell in normal mode. Decrypt firmwareAfter viewing at the Lua web files, I found the shell script for the call. Now I can get decrypt firmware file and duplicate it in a new router of the same model!","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Hardware","permalink":"https://timonpeng.com/tags/Hardware/"},{"name":"Reverse engineering","slug":"Reverse-engineering","permalink":"https://timonpeng.com/tags/Reverse-engineering/"},{"name":"Router","slug":"Router","permalink":"https://timonpeng.com/tags/Router/"}]},{"title":"Mosec 2019 badge crack","slug":"mosec-2019-badge-crack","date":"2019-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-07-28T07:28:24.664Z","comments":true,"path":"mosec-2019-badge-crack/","link":"","permalink":"https://timonpeng.com/mosec-2019-badge-crack/","excerpt":"Turn on the power, convert the handset light to morse code, decode it is M0S8C74.","text":"Turn on the power, convert the handset light to morse code, decode it is M0S8C74.
